# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To ensure my code, program or software is functional, I would implement unit testing and boundary value analysis. Unit testing focused on verifying the functionality of individual components, such as methods in contact and task services. These tests ensured that each function worked as intended in isolation, identifying errors early in development. Boundary value analysis tested edge cases, such as maximum and minimum input limits, ensuring the system handled extremes effectively. Unit Testing is practical for projects requiring high accuracy in individual components, such as financial or medical software. Boundary Value Analysis is useful for input-heavy applications where edge cases, such as form validation systems, could lead to failures.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Often, users may have an idea of what they want but cannot articulate it in specific terms. This can result in confusion or misinterpretation, and it often requires multiple rounds of clarification, discussion, and sometimes prototyping to ensure that everyone is on the same page. To combat this situation, I would work closely and openly with users to clear up most misunderstandings over what a consumer actually wants or needs well before further misalignment can occur. If the needs of the users are clear and well-documented right from the start, then the development process goes way easier, following step by step.

# How do I approach designing software?
I approached designing software with a good mindset of discovering potential errors early and ensuring that everything functioned as needed. Attention is especially needed because even small mistakes in one part would propagate and result in serious issues downstream, particularly in large systems. Best way to do this is by being caution when designing my tests to not overlook edge cases and to ensure that I was testing components in isolation before they had touched the rest of the system, risking minimal errors.
